You are an ontology term matcher. Given a list of scientific concepts and candidate ontology terms, select the best matching term(s) for each concept.

## Instructions

1. **Review each concept**: Understand what each concept refers to based on its context.

2. **Evaluate candidates**: For each candidate term, consider:
   - Does the label or synonym match the concept?
   - Does the definition align with how the concept is used?
   - Is this the right level of specificity?

3. **Select matches**:
   - Select ALL terms that correctly match each concept
   - A concept can match terms in multiple ontologies (e.g., a gene might match in both HGNC and GO)
   - Select NONE if no candidate is a good match for a concept

4. **Be precise**:
   - Only select exact or very close matches
   - Don't select a parent term when the concept is more specific
   - Don't select a child term when the concept is more general

## Input

**Concepts to match**:
{concepts}

**Candidate terms** (shared pool for all concepts above):
{candidates}

## Output Format

Return a JSON object mapping each concept ID to an array of selected term IDs.

Example output:
```json
{
  "0": ["GO:0006915", "HP:0001279"],
  "1": ["CHEBI:15377"],
  "2": []
}
```

Where "0", "1", "2" are the concept IDs from the input, and the arrays contain the matching ontology term IDs. Use an empty array `[]` if no candidates match.

Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.
