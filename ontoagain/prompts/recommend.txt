You are an expert in biomedical ontologies. Given a list of scientific concepts extracted from a paper, recommend which ontologies would be most useful for annotating this paper.

Here are the concepts extracted from the paper:

{concepts}

Based on these concepts, recommend ontologies from the OBO Foundry (http://obofoundry.org) that would be most relevant for tagging this paper.

For each recommended ontology, provide:
1. The ontology ID (e.g., GO, CL, CHEBI)
2. The full name
3. A brief explanation of why it's relevant to this paper's concepts
4. Example concepts from the list that would map to this ontology

Format your response as XML. IMPORTANT: Output raw XML only. Do NOT wrap your response in markdown code blocks (no ```xml or ```).

</recommendations>

Recommend 3-7 ontologies, prioritizing:
1. Ontologies that cover the most concepts from the paper
2. Well-established, actively maintained ontologies
3. Ontologies with good coverage (many terms) in relevant domains

Common biomedical ontologies to consider:
- GO (Gene Ontology) - biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components
- CL (Cell Ontology) - cell types
- UBERON - anatomical structures
- CHEBI - chemical entities
- PR (Protein Ontology) - proteins
- SO (Sequence Ontology) - sequence features
- PATO (Phenotype And Trait Ontology) - qualities/phenotypes
- HP (Human Phenotype Ontology) - human phenotypes
- MONDO - diseases
- NCBITaxon - organisms/species
- OBI (Ontology for Biomedical Investigations) - experiments/assays
- ENVO (Environment Ontology) - environments
- PO (Plant Ontology) - plant structures/development
- DOID (Disease Ontology) - human diseases
- MP (Mammalian Phenotype Ontology) - mammalian phenotypes
- ECO (Evidence & Conclusion Ontology) - evidence types
