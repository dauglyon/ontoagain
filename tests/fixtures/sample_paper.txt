Abstract

The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a critical role in regulating apoptosis in response to cellular stress. In this study, we investigated the effects of p53 activation on programmed cell death in HeLa cells.

Methods

HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were treated with doxorubicin to induce DNA damage and p53 activation. Western blot analysis was performed to measure p53 and BAX protein levels.

Results

Treatment with doxorubicin resulted in a significant increase in p53 expression. The model organism showed elevated levels of BAX, a pro-apoptotic protein. Caspase-3 activation was observed 24 hours post-treatment, indicating the initiation of apoptosis.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that p53 activation leads to BAX upregulation and subsequent caspase-3 activation. This is consistent with the known role of p53 as a regulator of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Further studies are needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which the tumor suppressor controls cell fate decisions.
