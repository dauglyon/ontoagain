      Chemical-Induced-Disease (CID) relationships ONLY.

      CONSTRAINTS:
      - Subject MUST be a CHEMICAL or DRUG
      - Object MUST be the ADVERSE EFFECT directly caused by the chemical
      - Direction: chemical → disease (never disease → disease)

      CAUSAL LANGUAGE PATTERNS - EXTRACT these:
      1. "X-induced Y" → X causes Y (e.g., "isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity")
      2. "X causes/caused Y" or "X leads to Y"
      3. "Y following/after X administration/treatment"
      4. "Y associated with X therapy" (when describing adverse effects)
      5. "X resulted in Y" or "X produced Y"
      6. Lists: "X causes A, B, and C" → extract ALL THREE relationships

      DO NOT EXTRACT - these are NOT adverse effects:
      1. Treatment context: "X for treating Y" → Y is treated condition, not adverse effect
      2. Pre-existing: "patients with Y received X" → Y is background
      3. Mechanism only: "X activates receptors" → no adverse outcome mentioned
      4. General categories when specific exists: prefer "Cardiotoxicity" over "Cardiovascular Diseases"

      MULTIPLE ADVERSE EFFECTS:
      When one chemical causes multiple effects, extract ALL:
      "Lithium causes depression, cyanosis, and arrhythmia" → 3 separate relationships

      SPECIFICITY:
      - PREFER specific toxicity terms (-toxicity) over general disease categories
      - PREFER specific syndromes over general disorders
    term_format: "Verb phrases like 'induces', 'causes', 'leads to'"
