      MESH 2015 Descriptors (D-numbers) - the main MESH controlled vocabulary.

      DISAMBIGUATION RULES FOR D-NUMBERS:

      For DISEASES/ADVERSE EFFECTS - PREFER in this order:
      1. Specific toxicity terms ending in "-toxicity": Cardiotoxicity > Cardiovascular Diseases
      2. Specific syndromes/disorders: Delirium > Mental Disorders, Atrial Flutter > Arrhythmias
      3. Disorder over symptom: "Anxiety Disorders" > "Anxiety", "Depressive Disorder" > "Depression"

      For CHEMICALS - use D-numbers when:
      - No C-number exists for the specific drug
      - Text refers to a drug CLASS (anticonvulsants, beta-blockers)
      - Well-established chemicals: Lithium, Dexamethasone, Isoproterenol

      CRITICAL: When both general and specific disease terms match the concept:
      - Select ONLY the most specific term
      - "Cardiotoxicity" NOT "Cardiovascular Diseases"
      - "Hepatotoxicity" NOT "Liver Diseases"
    term_format: "Capitalized noun phrases like 'Acetaminophen', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Delirium'"

      MESH 2015 Supplementary Concepts (C-numbers) - specific named substances.

      DISAMBIGUATION RULES FOR C-NUMBERS:

      PREFER C-numbers over D-numbers for specific drug names:
      - "lenalidomide" → C467567 (NOT D013792 Thalidomide)
      - "bortezomib" → C400082 (NOT parent D-number)
      - "sorafenib", "bevacizumab", "clopidogrel" → use their C-numbers

      How to identify: C-number synonyms contain the EXACT lowercase drug name.

      Use C-numbers for relationship SUBJECTS (the chemical causing the effect).
      Use D-numbers for relationship OBJECTS (the adverse effect/disease).
    term_format: "Lowercase drug/chemical names like 'lenalidomide', 'bevacizumab', 'sorafenib'"
